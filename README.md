# Sav Weather App
## I created a web application that tells you the weather of any city in the US, it includes the daily weather temperature, humidity, and the wind speeds of said state. This project helped me better understand API's and how to impliment them and how to fetch data from the API's servers. This application can be used to tell the weather of the area and plan your day accordingly.
